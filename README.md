# How to run
Two runnable classes are provided in the project:
- `ServerCLI`
- `ClientApplication`

To run the server, run the ServerCLI class. This will start the server on port 4040.

**Commands**
- `start` `true`or `false`, false for single threaded, true for multi threaded.
- `stop` stops the server.
- `exit` exits the server.

To run the client, run the ClientApplication class. To execute commands on the client side, the server needs to be 
running.
